# Basic Scientific Calculator

This project implements a basic scientific calculator using JavaScript. It provides functionalities for performing common mathematical operations, including:

* Arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
* Scientific functions: sine (sin), cosine (cos), tangent (tan)
* Other mathematical operations: square root (sqrt), cube root (cbrt), square (x^2), cube (x^3), and modulus (|)

## Getting Started

To run the calculator:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)<your-username>/basic-scientific-calculator.git

2. **Open the HTML file:** 
   * Locate the HTML file (e.g., index.html) within the cloned repository.
   * Open the HTML file in your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

## Usage

The calculator interface consists of buttons representing the various operations. Simply click on the desired buttons to perform calculations. The result will be displayed in the designated output field.
**Example:**
* To calculate the sin of 45 degree:
   * Enter "45" in the input field.
   * Click the "sin" button.
   * The result (approximately 0.707) will be displayed in the output field.
